  <strong>Hello please grade Iproject 3 for IProject 3</strong>
  <strong>Instead of making a dispachter, I made it so the kernel checks if the CPU is currently executing a process or if there are any processes in the ready queue </strong>
  <strong>And implemented the context switches there</strong>
  <strong>pls dont take too many points off, pls.</strong>
