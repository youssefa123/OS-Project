\section{ What are the advantages and disadvantages of using the same system call interface for manipulating both files and devices?}

There are some notable advantages for using the same system call interface. The first advantage is simplicity. Programmers/Developers would have an easier time learning and using a single set of commands. Another advantage would be reusability, so Programmers/Developers can reuse code, which is better for saving time in the long run.

\section{2. Would it be possible for the user to develop a new command interpreter using the system call interface provided by the operating system? How?}

Yes, it is possible unless the system is a real-time operating system, which is hard because you have to map out the timing constraints. But without that, it would be possible with an understanding of what a shell is and how to let it interact with the operating system kernel through a system call to allow for commands to be executed.
